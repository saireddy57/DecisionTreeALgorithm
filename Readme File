The model will be used to predict whether a passenger survived or not.
We will be using a decision tree to make predictions about the Titanic data set from Kaggle. This data set provides information on the Titanic passengers
dataset info and link - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BigDataGal/Python-for-Data-Science/master/titanic-train.csv Will use only Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp (Siblings aboard), Parch (Parents/children aboard), and Fare to predict whether a passenger survived.
